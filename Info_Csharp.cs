// CLASS DEFINITIONS

internal static class ToolsArgs
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
When a variable is declared directly in a class, it is often referred to as a field(or attribute).
It is not required, but it is a good practice to start with an uppercase first letter when naming classes.
Also, it is common that the name of the C# file and the class matches, as it makes our code organized. However it is not required (like in Java).
